# Gate-Level-CAD-tool-design-using-TCL-Tk
Hierarchical Representation of Gate-Level Netlist using TCL/TK


Designed a simple hierarchical gate-level schematic in TCL/Tk using a synthesized gate-level netlist. 
Designed a basic CAD tool for Static Timing Analysis using TCL/Tk and C language. The graphical tool takes a set of interconnected nodes (modules) with their individual delays as inputs in the form of an adjacency matrix and calculates the arrival time, required time and the slack of each node and displays the result on the window along side the graph of the interconnected nodes.
